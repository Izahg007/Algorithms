# Algorithms
Codes for algorithms that i could not find on the internet or solved myself

The codes are written in C++, you are welcome to optimize the code and point out any errors.
Please do not blatantly copy the code for your assignments or tests if u are a student(if u don't have time then it is okay). Try to understand it first and implement it on your own.

I will expand the list as i get time, 
Thank you.
